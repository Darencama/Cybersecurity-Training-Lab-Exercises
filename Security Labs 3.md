## Title: Configuring Vulnerability scanning and analyzing outputs

### Summary: In this lab I will be demonstrating how to utilize a vulnerability management scanner as well as create a user and implement that user into a group. Within the group i will also implement the right security policies.


 ### Steps: 
 - Create group and user
 - Implement group policies and user right assignments
 - Open a seperate (VM) and create credential for our host 
 - Scan our main host and analyze the potential vulernabilities 

### Results: 
We created a secured group with both the right policies and user assigments. We created a credential for our host that going to be scan and create a new task as well. Once we finished up those steps with scanned our main host. We then review our report for vulernabilities and observe the severity of them.
