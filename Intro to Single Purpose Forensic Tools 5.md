 ### Steps: 
 - Make sure you switch to the forensics directory
 - View the file with the hashing information 
 - Mount a partition
 - Use Foremost to carve files
 - Use the HEX editor from the terminal

### Results: 
We now know how to view files with hashing informations. We then also mounted a partition and used Foremost to carve files and finally we got utilize the HEX editor from the terminal.
